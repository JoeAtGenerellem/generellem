Some initial ideas on contributing to the project:

* Many ways to contribute - code, documentation, discussion, issues, help others, etc.
* It's probably best to coordinate before changing something - general clarification on what is being done and who's doing it
* We use PRs to submit code - should have an approval before merging

I'll probably formalize this more as time goes on and more people get involved.
