# Contributing

There are developers who maintain Generellem and will continue to do so. However, the project is open to participation from anyone that wants to make a contribution. This guide discusses items that everyone should be aware of in the contribution process. We'll discuss different ways to contribute, coordination process, and how to submit code.

## Types of contributions

There are many ways to contribute such as code documentation, and helping others. The following sections discuss this more.

### New Features

There are two way to see existing new features: [The Generellem Project](https://github.com/users/generellem/projects/2) or [Issues](https://github.com/generellem/generellem/issues). By design, we turn all new project cards into Issues so they show up in the Issues too, where it might be easier for some people to read details. Of course, reading via the Project gives a good idea of each issue's status.

If there's an issue that you would like to work on, reach out to Joe so he can assign that to you. If you don't see a feature that you would like to have, either create a new one in Issues or visit the Discussions section if you want to discuss it with other community members first.

Really, we need at least some type of governance over new issues. Coordinating these things helps people from wasting a lot of time going in a direction that doesn't fit the project. Communicating about it is better. Also, it keeps multiple people from working on the same feature at the same time.

If you're a new developer, look for the issues tagged as "good first issue". Of course, if you just want to jump in head first go-for-it. Please coordinate and ask for help so you don't flounder too long on a single issue. We want to see you succeed.

### Bug Fixes

In many ways, the bug fix process is similar to New Features in that we want to coordinate and track each fix. Keeping track of bugs also a metric that helps measure the health and quality of the system. Please search open and closed issues to see if the bug has already been addressed before submitting a new issue.

### Unit Tests

You can run code coverage on Generellem test and might find gaps that we should have written a unit test for. Similar to New Feature, please coordinate. You want to avoid writing a unit test in code that someone else is currently working on, where they would normally be expected to write those tests.

### Documentation

There are two main areas of documentation: Markdown in source code and the Wiki. The Markdown files are like this fine, CONTRIBUTING.md. They're located and named to fit with GitHub conventions. e.g. by placing them in the root folder, GitHub can automatically link to them through the project's main page right-side menu. The Wiki is a growing repository of documentation on architecture and developer documentation.

You're welcome to update the documentation in any way that would improve it. Even spelling corrections and grammar are fine. The standard is US English so we don't accidentally change back and forth between other forms. For the source code Markdown, you'll need to submit a PR, explained below. For the Wiki, you're welcome to do small spelling or gramatical improvements as you need. However, if you want to do an extensive change, please coordinate via Discussion or Issues.

### Helping Others

There are various ways to help others. The first is by participating in Issues and Discussions. You can ask questions, answer other people's questions, or just generally participate in any discussion - as long as it's on topic for Generellem. New developers might want to take on an Issue and might need help. In other cases, there might be a new feature of such significant size the people might want to form a team to coordinate the work. The sky is the limit here and everything that you and others do contributes to the community and helps you achieve whatever goals you set out for yourself.

## Submitting Code

We'll have a process for submitting code that will involve a PR and reviews. I'm still thinking about this and will resume later.

## Summary

TBD - Feedback on this entire contribution process is welcome.
