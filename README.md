### Generellem

Generellem is an opinionated framework for implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) processes. Essentially, you can use AI on your own documents.

#### Project Status:

Generellem is still in Beta. The Beta 2 release has several breaking changes. If you need help, please visit [Discussions](https://github.com/JoeAtGenerellem/generellem/discussions) or create a new [Issue](https://github.com/JoeAtGenerellem/generellem/issues).

The framework is cross-platform. The plans are to target the latest version of C# and the latest .NET LTS release. The initial releases are building around Azure and Windows technologies.

Generellem open-source is the underlying engine of the commercial [Generellem SaaS](https://generellem.ai/) product. So, you can expect regular updates over time.

#### Getting Started

There's a growing list of demos that you can clone and run to get a feel for how the framework works. You might want to start with [GenerellemConsole](https://github.com/JoeAtGenerellem/generellem/tree/main/GenerellemConsole) which has foundational support. We'll have more demos as the technology support grows. e.g. [MSGraphDemo](https://github.com/JoeAtGenerellem/generellem/tree/main/MSGraphDemo) shows how to work with OneDrive via Microsoft Graph.

We have a growing library of documentation to include Architecture, Getting Started, and more. Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/generellem/generellem/wiki) for more information.

#### Contributing

Generellem is an open-source project and we welcome your contributions. Please visit the [Contributing](https://github.com/JoeAtGenerellem/generellem/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) page for more information.

If you are a [Generellem SaaS](https://generellem.ai/) customer and need support for a specific data source, document type, or platform, you're welcome to add that here for quicker implementation.
