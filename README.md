### Generellem

Generellem is an opinionated framework for implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) processes. Essentially, you can use AI on your own documents.

#### Project Status:

Generellem is now a v1.0 released product. If you find a bug, create a new [Issue](https://github.com/JoeAtGenerellem/generellem/issues).

The framework is cross-platform. We will be targeting the latest version of C# and the latest .NET LTS release, which is currently .NET 8.0. The initial releases are building around Azure and Windows technologies and we'll expand to other plaforms and technologies as we go. BTW, the demos already run on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

Generellem open-source is the underlying engine of the commercial [Generellem SaaS](https://generellem.ai/) product. You can expect regular updates over time.

#### Getting Started

There's a growing list of demos that you can clone and run to get a feel for how the framework works. You might want to start with [GenerellemConsole](https://github.com/JoeAtGenerellem/generellem/tree/main/GenerellemConsole) which has foundational support. We'll have more demos as the technology support grows. e.g. [MSGraphDemo](https://github.com/JoeAtGenerellem/generellem/tree/main/MSGraphDemo) shows how to work with OneDrive via Microsoft Graph.

We have a growing library of documentation to include Architecture, Getting Started, and more. Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/generellem/generellem/wiki) for more information.
