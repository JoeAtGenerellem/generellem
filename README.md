### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Generellem is a tool for using arbitrary documents with LLMs so anyone can have AI that is specific to their domain.

Here's the initial plan:

1. Consume and process files for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
2. Interact with an LLM to return a response to a caller
3. Add to a reusable library package for anyone to consume

Initial Tech

* Python
* TBD

As you can see, this very brand new. Everything has to start somewhere. This is open source and community participation is welcome.
