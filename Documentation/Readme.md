# Generellem Documentation Readme

This "Documentation" folder exists for demo and testing of Generellem. Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/generellem/generellem/wiki) for official developer documentation.

The demo program has a FileSystem.json file that specifies this folder as a document source path. This means when you do the [Getting Started](https://github.com/generellem/generellem/wiki/Getting-Started) demo, you can ask any question in any of the documents in this folder.

>Note: *.doc, *.ppt, and *.xls files don't work yet, but *.docx, *.pptx, and *.xlsx work fine.
